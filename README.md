Live Demo: https://achen5.github.io/boxing-scorecard-app/

Score a boxing match using your computer! Casual boxing fans usually have a hard time keeping score during a match. This web app helps keep score by calculating them after every round.
In championship boxing matches, a boxer can earn up to 10 points per boxing round. The winner of the round gets 10 points, whereas the losing one gets less than 10. 

## Future Developments
- Add a button that converts the user's scorecard into an image file. That way, the user can download and share their score. Sharing boxing scorecards is very popular in Discord's boxing server.
- Let the user adjust the number of rounds on the scorecard.
