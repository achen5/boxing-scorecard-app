BOXING SCORECARD APP

4/3/2021
- Start time: 7:35, 
	- If both fighers KD each other, the knockdowns cancel each other out.
	- How do you cache the round scores in case the user refreshes the page?
	- Is it a good idea to even support IE 
	- Bug 
		- If someone throughout the fight removes a score from a previous round,
			then tries to change the score in the current round. The "please fill 
			in the previous round" message appears and removes their current score.
		- Removing the current score could confuse the user.
		- Filling in the scorecard before changing the name makes the results box
			have the wrong name.
		- This app does NOT count for TD and DQ. Do this in a future update.
Oh jesus christ. IE does not suppport template literals

we compile code for browser support, if that's important
		- Use babel for browser support.

@theCalifornia1994 If you're using a framework chances are that a compilation process is already set up. You'd just need to define what you want to support. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, I'd recommend reading about NPM packages, package.json, WebPack & Babel

	- http://127.0.0.1:5500/

4/2/2021
- Start time: 4:10, 2 hours and 30 minutes
	- Issues
		- Autofill to 9
		- Max value for inputs is 10, mini is 0.

3/29/2021
- Start time: 8:35, 45 minutes
	- I wrote an function that calculates where the KO happened for each corner.
	- Issues
		- Do you need to compare each corner's KO round? is there a way to check
			each corner at the same time?

3/27/2021
- Start time: 10:45, 2 hours and 15 minutes 
	- Issues
		- How do you calculate the round the KO happened in?
		- In what cases should you autofill a round?
		- How do you autofill the other round one round is filled in as 10?

3/23/2021
- Start time: 8:20, 
	- Assume the current KO round is the round after the last filled-in round.
	- That means the KO round is the first round that returns a null on the scorecard
	- "checked" is an internal JavaScript property. the JavaScript property is 
		NOT connected to the HTML "checked" attribute. 
	- View HTML element as a Javascript object
		console.dir(htmlElement);
	- Issues
		- Now that you know to see which radio button is checked, how do you extract
			the value from that button?
		-  Again, how do you know check which round is the final round?

3/22/2021
- Start time: 9:50, 45 minutes
	- Window.getComputedStyle() does call get the property from the stylesheet,
		and the property is overridden by inline styling.

3/21/2021
- Start time: 1:20, 1 hour and 45 minutes
	- If one score is 10, the other is set to 9.
	- "This fight ended by knockout!" options 
		- Who won by knockout?
		- What is a KO or TKO*
		- In most cases, a Technical Knockout (TKO) happens when the referee stops
			a fight while the losing boxer is still standing.
		- Update result button
	- The difference between a KO and TKO is that the losing boxer who not knocked
		down before the fight was ended.
	- Issues
		- How do you close the knockout modal?
		- How do you figure out which round the fight ended?
		- When do you auto-fill a round?
			- When one scorebox is filled with 10

3/20/2021
- You may only want to display the current and previous rounds to save space.
- You need a swing round button.
- We need a KO button
- Final score 59-54, Ortiz

3/19/2021
- Start time: 5:15, 1 hour and 15 minutes
	- A fight is not over until all the scores are filled in.

Hi All, learning JavaScript here. Quick question. 
Say I'm trying to initialize a property using a constructor like below
function Tree(name) {
  this.name = name
}
Does "this" refer to the Tree object or does it refer to any objects created from Tree?
suXin â€” Today at 9:44 PM
it will refer to newly created Tree instance
granted you call this with new

- Creating a function on an object itself a worse option than defining it on the
	prototype. That's because if the method is defined on the prototype, it only 
	needs to be created once. Whereas if its defined on the object, its created 
	everytime a new object is created.
- Formulated the scorecard so it works for any corner.
- Issues
	- How do you compare each corner's score to another?
- Corner.prototype.check = function(){console.log(this)};
	- Refers to the object using it.
    //red.test1();
    /*
    red.scoreBoxesAll = document.querySelectorAll(".round-score-box[data-corner='red']");
    for (let i = 0; i < red.scoreBoxesAll.length; i++) {
        var redScore = Number(red.scoreBoxesAll[i].value); // null values are converted to 0.
        red.scoresAll.push(redScore);
        red.totalScore = red.totalScore + redScore;
    }*/
    //console.log(red)

- Start time: 8:55, 1 hour
- Issues
	- You're able to get the score. Should you have the function calculate the itself?
	- How do you keep yourself from getting confused by all the different names?
	- What values should you keep for next time?

3/14/2021
- What should the app do?
	- Calculate the current scorecard across multiple rounds. 12 rounds in total
	- Allow the user to type in each boxer's name. Add a character limit.
	- Give the current scorecards and say who is winning.
	- Calculate number of close rounds. Have a "This round was close" checkbox.

- Every time a number is added to an input, calculate all the 
- Issues
	- How do you add a score to a scorecard? How do you ensure that the right scorecard
		goes to the correct fighter?
	- How do you make sure that the scorecard is correct, if the scorer adjusts
		his/her score?
